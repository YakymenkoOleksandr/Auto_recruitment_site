    "description": "Hello! My name is Ruslan, I have been engaged in car selection for more than five years, helping clients find the perfect cars, taking into account their needs and budget. Over the years, I have tested hundreds of different cars, learned to recognize even the smallest technical nuances and hidden defects. Therefore, I want to tell you a little more about the nuances that occur when selecting a car, and also why it is worth using car selection services."
